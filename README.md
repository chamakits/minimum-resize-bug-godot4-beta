## Minimum resize bug

Trying to setup a minimum project with lots (too many?) debug prints trying to find out the difference between the window sizes.

See the output on [print-outputs](print-outputs) to compare the output of beta 8 and beta 9.  The issue is still present on beta 13.


You can also see `# SEE ME: ` comment on the [sub_node.gd](sub_node.gd#L7) file to uncomment the line below to fix the issue.
